# Hello.

This is my personal website, built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It contains stuff about me, some blog posts as well as some cheat sheets I've made for various programming-y things.

## Development

Use the node version specified in the `.nvmrc` file

```bash
nvm use;
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install;
```

Run the app in development mode

```bash
npm run dev;
```

## Building

Statically compiles the app to the `out/` directory

```bash
npm run export
```
